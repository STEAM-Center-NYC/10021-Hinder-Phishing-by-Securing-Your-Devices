 <h1>How to Prevent Phishing</h1>  
 <b>Stay up to Date With Phishing Scams</b>
        <p>Phshing is a lucrative activity, meaning there is lots of money in developing new tactics to catch people. You are susceptible if you haven't learned of thier existance. If you keep up to date, you can modify your browsing tactics to allow yourself to succesfully avoid  getting your data stolen. </p> 
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li><b>Identifing a Phishing Attack</b></li>
        <p> The first step of protection is figuring out if someone is trying to phish you. Some common tells are a very generic message, the have large finicial rewards, very urgent deadline (designed to make you rush and be less thorough), Asking for personal data (First name, Last name, SSN, DOB), bad grammar, and fake email addresses.    </p>
        <img src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Cybersecurity.png/640px-Cybersecurity.png"height= "150" width="250" style="float:right; padding-left:8px; padding-right:8px;">
    <li><b>Protecting Yourself</b></li>
        <p> The number one way to protect yourself from phishing is to think before you click something. Whether it be a link or an e-mail, make sure its from a reputable source. Hover over a link before you click it because in the bottom left of your browser it will show you if it goes to the actual site you are look for or will direct you to a more malicious site. Do not click on spam e-mails as they can have malicious code in the image in the e-mail. They can have e-mail that look as if the are from a reputable company but they are missing something they hope you don't notice. For example "nick@mazon.com" instead of "nick@amazon.com" which is what the actual e-mail would look like. Don't click on random links from friends either as they may not know that it is from a phishing site.  A  common way to identify a phishing attempt is a slight mispelling of an already well established site. One example of this is "amazonn.com" as opposed to "amazon.com" Make sure your sites have https and not http as https is the secure verison. There should be a lock next to the URL on the address bar. If the site says "not secure" in the browser, you should avoid it. </p>
    <li><b>Update Your Browser</b></li>

        <p> Make sure to keep your browser updated to the latest verison.This is because they are release in response to the loopholes hackers explioted in that first place. This allows your browser to have the latest security updates and patches which can nullify the effect of the older verisons of these types of scams. Thought this is not foolproof as hacker will invitably make ways around these patches as well so stay vigilant.  </p>
    <li> <b>Watch out for Pop-Ups</b></li>
    <img src= https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/In-page_pop-up_window_advertisement.jpg/640px-In-page_pop-up_window_advertisement.jpg height="150" width="230" style="float:left; padding-right:8px; padding-left:8px;">
        <p>Sometimes pop-up ads masquerade as legitimate parts of the website you're browsing. This can lead to you accidentally clicking on them and getting a nasty virus. A feature that helps with most pop-ups is one most browsers. If you go into your browsers settings you are likely to find a "block all Pop-Ups" button. This feature is pretty self-explanatory, but may not work for all pop-ups, for these make sure you do not click the cancel button always click the small "x" in the corner as the cancel can sometimes lead to phishing. </p>
    <li> <b>Don't Give Out Personal Information</b></li>

        <p> If an e-mail is sent to you and it links to a website, make sure that the website is said company's official website. Or else it's likely a phishing scam. Do not enter any personal or finicial information into a website unless you are sure it is trusted. </p>
