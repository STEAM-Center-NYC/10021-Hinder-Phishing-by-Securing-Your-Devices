 <h1>How to Prevent Phishing</h1>   
<ol>
    <li> Stay up to date with phishing scams</li>
        <p>Phshing is a lucrative activity, meaning there is lots of money in developing new tactics to catch people. You are susceptible if you haven't learned of thier existance. If you keep up to date, you can modify your browsing tactics to allow yourself to succesfully aviod  getting your data stolen. </p>
    <li>Protecting Yourself</li>
        <p> The number one way to protect yourself from phishing is to think before you click something. Whether it be a link or an email, make sure its from a reputable source. Do not click on spam emails as  they can have malicious code in the image in the email. Don't click on random links from friends either as they may not know that it is from a phishing site. Make sure your sites have https and not http as https is the secure verison. There should be a lock next to the URL on the address bar. </p>
    <li>Update Your Browser</li>
        <p> Make sure to keep your browser updated to the latest verison.This is because they are release in response to the loopholes hackers explioted in that first place. This allows your browser to have the latest security updates and patches which can nullify the effect of the older verisons of these types of scams. Thought this is not foolproof as hacker will invitably make ways around these patches as well so stay vigilant.  </p>
    <li> Watch out for Pop-Ups</li>
        <p>Sometimes pop-up ads masquerade as legitimate parts of the website you're browsing. This can lead to you accidentally clicking on them and getting a nasty virus. A feature that helps with most pop-ups is one most browsers. If you go into your browsers settings you are likely to find a "block all Pop-Ups" button. This feature is pretty self-explanatory, but may not work for all pop-ups, for these make sure you do not click the cancel button always click the small "x" in the corner as the cancel can sometimes lead to phishing. </p>
    <li> Don't Give Out Personal Information</li>
        <p> If an email is sent to you and it links to a website, make sure that the website is said company's official website. Or else it's likely a phishing scam. Do not enter any personal or finicial information into a website unless you are sure it is trusted. </p>
