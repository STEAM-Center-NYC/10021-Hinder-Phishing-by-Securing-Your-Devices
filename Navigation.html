<h1>What is Phishing?</h1>
<div class="bg-primary row text-dark text-center border border-dark border-5 rounded-start" ></div>
<p>Phishing is when attackers send malicious emails designed to trick people into falling for a scam. The intent is often to get users to reveal financial information, system credenitals or other sensitive data.</p>
<p class="p1"> If this attack becomes successful personal data like login credentials and bank account information could be obtained; or malware can be installed automatically onto devices. </p>

<p>Phishing is when attackers send malicious emails designed to trick people into falling for a scam. The intent is often to get users to reveal financial information, system credenitals or other sensitive data.</p> <break>
</break>
<p>Sometimes hackers are satisfied with getting your personal data and credit card information for financial gain. In other cases, phishing emails are sent to gather employee login information or other details for use in more malicious attacks against a few individuals or a specific company. Phishing is a type of cyber attack that everyone should learn about in order to protect themselves and ensure email security throughout an organization.</p>

<h2 id="Whailing">Whailing</h2>
<p>Very similar to spear phishing, but goes an extra step further by targeting specific high level staff within an organization. The goal of whaling is to impersonate a C-level executive and use that authority to pressure staff members into sending sensitive information. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Spoofed fake email addresses</li>
    <li>Spoofed names</li>

<h2 id="Smishing">Smishing</h2>
<p>Smishing is a form of phishing that uses moblie phones as the attack platform. Sending Fradulent emails that seek to trick the recipient into opening a malware-laden attachment or clicking on a malware link.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mobile phones</li>
  <li>Social Insurance</li>
  <li>Credit Card</li>
  <li>Text Messages or SMS</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Vishing">Vishing</h2>
<p>Vishing is a cyber crime that uses the phone to steal personal confidential information from victims. Vishing relies on convicing victims that they are doing the right thing by responding to the caller. Involves using a phone to trick victims into handing over sensitive information, rather than an email.
  
  <h2 id="Angler Phishing">Angler Phishing</h2> 
  <p>Angler Phishing is a new type of phishing attack that targets social media users by disgusing as a customer service agent on social media in order to reach a disgruntled custom and obtain their personal information on account credenitals.</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>Instagram</li>
  <li>Twitter</li>
  <li>Facebook</li>
  <li>Tik Tok</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Business Email Compromise">Business Email Compromise</h2>
<p>is a targeted attack that focuses on companies who frequently conduct wire transfers and have global partnerships. Attackers use keyloggers, spoofed domains, and phishing attacks with the primary goals of tricking the victim into wiring money into the attackers account.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Wiring money into the attackers account</li>
  <li>Spoofed domain</li>
  <
</ul>
<h2 id="Clone Phishing">Clone Phishing</h2>
<p>The clone is a near copy to the original where the attachments or links are replaced with malware or a virus. The email is typically spoofed to appear like it is being sent by the original sender and will claim it is a simple re-send. What’s worse, the email is sent out to a large number of recipients and the attacker just waits for the victims who click it. When a victim succumbs to the cloned email, the attacker forwards the same forged email to the contacts from the victim’s inbox. This type of attack is considered the most harmful because it is hard for victims to suspect a spoofed email.</p>

<h2 id="Evil Twin Phishing">Evil Twin Phishing</h2>
<p>An evil twin attack is a spoofing cyberattack that works by tricking users into connecting to a fake Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network. Once a user is connected to an “evil twin” network, hackers can access everything from their network traffic to private login credentials.
 Evil twin attacks get their name from their ability to imitate legitimate Wi-Fi networks to the extent that they are indistinguishable from one another. This type of attack is particularly dangerous because it can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>

<h2 id="Smishing and Vishing">Smishing and Vishing </h2>
<p> Vishing involves using a phone to trick victims into handing over sensitive information, rather than an email. In a vishing attack, the threat actors call their target and use social engineering tactics to manipulate them into providing credential or financial information. Tactics often involve, like a lot of phishing attacks, a deadline or time limit to create a sense of urgency or impersonating someone with authority in order to make the user feel like they have no choice but to hand over information. Smishing is a closely related phishing attack that also uses phone numbers. But instead of voice mail, smishing uses text messages to trick users. These messages could contain a phone number for a targeted user to call or a link to an attacker-controlled website hosting malware or a phishing page. Victims tend to trust text messages more than a suspicious email. But, it’s more challenging to identify a vishing attack than a phishing and smishing attack.</p>
