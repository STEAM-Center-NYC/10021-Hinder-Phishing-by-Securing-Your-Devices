<h2 id="Email Phishing"> Email Phishing</h2>
<p>With a majority of those messages being sent in massive waves to thousands of recipients.These attacks often impersonate well-known brands, and disguise themselves as shipping updates, password reset requests, and overdue invoice notices from fictitious companies. </p>
<h2 id="Spear Phishing">Spear Phishing</h2>
<p>Emails use a much more targeted approach to trick their victims by using company specific information to make their messages even more believable. Information such as phone numbers, email signatures, and staff names are used in these attacks to appear as legitimate as possible. Attackers spend time collecting this information on websites, and sometimes stealing it from other email addresses that have been compromised.</p>
<h2 id="Whailing">Whailing</h2>
<p>ery similar to spear phishing, but goes an extra step further by targeting specific high level staff within an organization. The goal of whaling is to impersonate a C-level executive and use that authority to pressure staff members into sending sensitive information. </p>
<h2 id="Smishing and Vishing">Smishing and Vishing </h2>
<p> Vishing involves using a phone to trick victims into handing over sensitive information, rather than an email. In a vishing attack, the threat actors call their target and use social engineering tactics to manipulate them into providing credential or financial information. Tactics often involve, like a lot of phishing attacks, a deadline or time limit to create a sense of urgency or impersonating someone with authority in order to make the user feel like they have no choice but to hand over information. Smishing is a closely related phishing attack that also uses phone numbers. But instead of voice mail, smishing uses text messages to trick users. These messages could contain a phone number for a targeted user to call or a link to an attacker-controlled website hosting malware or a phishing page. Victims tend to trust text messages more than a suspicious email. But, it’s more challenging to identify a vishing attack than a phishing and smishing attack.</p>
<h2 id="Angler Phising">Angler phishing</h2>
<p>Angler phishing is a specific type of phishing attack that exists on social media. Angler phishing attacks are launched using bogus corporate social media accounts. cyber criminals are aware that organisations are increasingly using social media to interact with their customers, whether that’s for marketing and promotional purposes or to offer a simple route for customers to ask questions or make complaints.</p>
<h2 id="Business Email Compromise">Business Email Compromise</h2>
<p>is a targeted attack that focuses on companies who frequently conduct wire transfers and have global partnerships. Attackers use keyloggers, spoofed domains, and phishing attacks with the primary goals of tricking the victim into wiring money into the attackers account.  </p>
<h2 id="Clone Phishing">Clone Phishing</h2>
<p>The clone is a near copy to the original where the attachments or links are replaced with malware or a virus. The email is typically spoofed to appear like it is being sent by the original sender and will claim it is a simple re-send. What’s worse, the email is sent out to a large number of recipients and the attacker just waits for the victims who click it. When a victim succumbs to the cloned email, the attacker forwards the same forged email to the contacts from the victim’s inbox. This type of attack is considered the most harmful because it is hard for victims to suspect a spoofed email.</p>
<h2 id="Evil Twin Phishing">Evil Twin Phishing</h2>
<p>An evil twin attack is a spoofing cyberattack that works by tricking users into connecting to a fake Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network. Once a user is connected to an “evil twin” network, hackers can access everything from their network traffic to private login credentials.
 Evil twin attacks get their name from their ability to imitate legitimate Wi-Fi networks to the extent that they are indistinguishable from one another. This type of attack is particularly dangerous because it can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>

<h2> Phishing started in the 1990s</h2>
<p>the existence of phishing was huge in the 1990s, a group of hackers are known as the first 'phishers'. At the time it was very easy to collect login credentials and personal information from users. </p>

<div><p class="p1">This is a fake website! asking the victim to enter their credentials or other information into the fake site’s interface. The malicious website will often leverage a subtle change to a known URL to trick users from NYC Environment Protection, however if you look very closely you can see the link name is not the same as the webpage name. This is phishing! </div></p>
