<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Clone Phishing">Clone Phishing</h2>
<p>The clone is a near copy to the original where the attachments or links are replaced with malware or a virus. The email is typically spoofed to appear like it is being sent by the original sender and will claim it is a simple re-send. What’s worse, the email is sent out to a large number of recipients and the attacker just waits for the victims who click it. When a victim succumbs to the cloned email, the attacker forwards the same forged email to the contacts from the victim’s inbox. This type of attack is considered the most harmful because it is hard for victims to suspect a spoofed email.</p>

<h2 id="Evil Twin Phishing">Evil Twin Phishing</h2>

 Evil twin attacks get their name from their ability to imitate legitimate Wi-Fi networks to the extent that they are indistinguishable from one another. This type of attack is particularly dangerous because it can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
